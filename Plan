Forever loop:
  If light sensor touches black:
    Move to the right, by operating left wheels faster than right
    This can be done with different severities or degrees. Let this be 150
  If left sensor touches black:
    Move to the left at 15°
  If right sensor touches green"
    Move to the right at 30°
  If left sensor touches green:
    Move to the left at 30°
  If silver is touched:
    Turn right 45°
Start turning left slowly until distance sensor senses something
Move right at 10° until distance sensor stops seeing
While loop until we touch the can
Pick can up
Move forward
If left touches white turn right at _ degrees
If right touches white turn right at _ degrees
If sensor touches silver, turn that direction and move until both do
Then, resume pseudocode to go back to start
